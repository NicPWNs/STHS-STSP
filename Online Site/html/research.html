  <strong>STSP Research Paper</strong><br>
                When it  comes to cyber-attacks, most people would picture a dark figure in a closed  room hacking away into a computer terminal with lines and lines of code.  Well that&rsquo;s not the case.  In fact, 66% of all cyber-attacks include the  use of social engineering which is exactly the opposite of the &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; stereotype.  Left and right, data is being stolen;  personal, private, and governmental all unsecure due to the people that created  it.  In today&rsquo;s age of cyber-attacks,  cyber espionage, and exploitation, our weakest link lies in human error and  unawareness of the cyber dimension.  This  vulnerability derived from the people can be fixed by the people as well,  through implications of cyber education and awareness.<br>
                So, what is  social engineering? You may be asking.   Merriam-Webster defines social engineering as &ldquo;the practice of making  laws or using other methods to influence public opinion and solve social  problems or improve social conditions&rdquo; which is very different compared to its  meaning in the cyber world.  When it  comes to cyber-attacks, social engineering is about the methods in which an  attacker uses to gain information by communicating with victim directly.  The most common of social engineering attacks  include phishing which is the creation of spoofed websites and emails to be  distributed in mass to random users for their data to retrieved, and also  spear-phishing where the attacker specifically targets and organization or  individual for a phishing attack.   Another slightly more uncommon approach is attempting to acquire  information by telephone usually behind the identity of a common business or  organization.  Finally, a very rare approach  to social engineering includes face to face contact, where the intruder acts  under another identity and attempts to talk their way into a place of limited  access to perform their attacks.   Ultimately, social engineering is typically  done as a preliminary action to gather information or data before performing  the actual attack and technical side.   Compared to other attacks, where hours and hours of time are devoted to  cracking passwords and such data, social engineering is typically favored as it  is a direct route to retrieving information fast.  When related to human error, we begin to see  that a large percentage of attacks occur by human error within social  engineering attacks.  Usually it is  simply that a subject or victim is unaware or untrained about cyber security  and the way attackers may attempt to gather data and this leads to misfortunate  identity theft, fraud and other issues.   Overall social engineering is prominent in the aspect of the weak human  link within cyber security, and its effect on further attacks.<br>
                When it comes to seeing how these attacks work  and how human awareness could have prevented them, it is best to look at a few  of the many popular occurrences where user error was the issue.  In 2013 the Twitter account of the associated  press reported &ldquo;Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barrack Obama  is injured&rdquo; which of course was not true.   In fact a hacking group/organization known as the Syrian Electronic Army  gained access to the account and posted this information.  When relating this to human error, we must  look into how they did it.  They simply  sent an email to several employees at the Associated Press with an enticing yet  related link that they fell for.  Upon  clicking on the link, a Trojan virus took control over the machines and from  there it was easy enough for the attackers to tweet!  From this we see that emails are very dangerous  in this example of spear-phishing and it was the human error of the employees  at the Associated Press that were not trained to not click on such links.  Another example that is much more recent is  the hacking of the CIA director&rsquo;s emails.   The teenager that performed the social engineering simply acted as a  Verizon employee and retrived crucial personal information about him.  With this first act of social engineering  completed, he then proceeded to perform another as he contacted AOL to gain  access to his email account.  Using  information such as his phone number and last four digits of his credit card,  he convinced AOL to reset his password, giving him access to the director&rsquo;s  account on October 12th, 2015.   With this example we see how it is more complex than just one email that  will allow access for attackers into an account, but it is a complex chain of  events that did this.  Overall when  comparing these two examples to the millions of attacks just like this  performed daily for money, information or just fun, it really comes down to the  user error and the way the user has control over their account that exposes  them to these simple attacks.<br>
                That&rsquo;s  enough talking about the human error, now let&rsquo;s get to how we can solve this  immense issue that&rsquo;s happening all around us and to you.  There are many educational platforms out there  that are paid for but also free on both the complex business level but also on  the individual level.  Programs offered  by the SANS institute are highly trusted and are top of the line when it comes  to protecting the largest of corporations, while programs such as Cyber Aces  are simple online practices and training for the personal user and are  free!  It is programs like these that  need to continue to grow and become abundant so that everyone has some level of  awareness on how they can protect themselves from cyber-attacks.  First we must spread awareness and our school  even takes part in this as there is usually a cyber security video played on  the Raven Report at least once a month.   There are also national efforts put on by the United States Department of  Homeland Security such as October being the designated month for Cyber Security  Awareness.  When it comes to my project,  I will be created an in depth portable interface platform for users to use and  learn about what is going on in the realm of cyber.  This will be an updated interface with the  latest in cyber news for the user to become more aware of cyber security.<br>
                In  conclusion, it is easy to see that the unaware human is main issue in cyber  security.  Those that work relentlessly  to secure our data are just as easily giving it away and this is endangering  our country in particular.  Awareness is  not going to occur by itself and therefore there must be some effort to spark  the revolution in fixing the human link in cyber security.  We must stop these simple attacks with simple  solutions, as the problems they create are much bigger.  Just as the speaker Albert Schultz, CEO  Krypteia LLC stated &ldquo;The human element is the most vulnerable,&rdquo; I agree, and I  would also say that we can fix it.</p>
