# Sussex Tech Senior Project (STSP) - Sussex Technical High School

I developed a "Portable User Interface for Cyber Security Awareness" as my senior capstone project at Sussex Technical High School (STHS). The completion of a final project was essential to graduate from the *Electronics and Computer Engineering* technical area.
