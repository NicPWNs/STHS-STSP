I developed a "Portable User Interface for Cyber Security Awareness" as my senior capstone project at Sussex Technical High School (STHS). The completion of a final project was essential to graduate from the *Electronics and Computer Engineering* technical area.

View the [final project slides](https://github.com/NicPWNs/STHS-STSP/raw/main/Portable%20User%20Interface%20For%20Cyber%20Security%20Awareness.pptx) to get the best understanding of the entire project.
